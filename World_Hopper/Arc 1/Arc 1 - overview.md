## Chapter 1

We are shown a little [[Hopper|seed]], in what looks like a void. It’s growing, “manifesting”.

The scene then cuts to a [[Toma|cloaked woman]]. We can see her pink hair peeking out. She is hiding from some people running by.

The seed sprouts a little bit more. There could be a text that narrates about the seed growing, despite the hostile environment. It’s growing where it shouldn’t.

The cloaked woman runs past some beggars, and the people chasing her ask some civilian if they saw the cloaked woman. She refused to answer, so they beat her. Then a beggar pointed towards where she ran, and asked for compensation. The pursuers ran straight past and stepped on the beggars fingers.

The seed grows into a person, who appears “somewhere”. They fall like the time traveler in Terminator, with their hands on the ground. A tiny sprout on top of their head. They are naked, and smooth like a ken doll. They slip around, like Bambi.

We cut back to a [[Braid lady|tall bulky woman with long white hair]], a single blue braid woven into a ponytail. She sighs when the pursuers aren’t having any progress, and gets on a horse to ride after her, herself. Close up of her sword shows runes on it that are glowing.

Hopper, still naked, finds a market. They try to hide a little, not quite understanding what’s going on and a bit scared. Crouching behind the market stalls, they see an apple. They grab it, smell it, then bite it. After that they grab clothing (kekw bible reference).

We see the woman with the cloak again, looking around before sneaking into an alley way. When she turns her back to the “camera”, we see runes on a massive axe on her back. 

Where is she sneaking in?

She meets a [[little girl]] inside, taking off her hood, 

saying that she’s thinking of her, and that it’s her duty to make sure that she is ok. The children are the future, in this wretched city. She gives the girl an object. 

The girl asks if she stole it, and she says she would never steal. She bought it, and somebody alerted the guards. So she has to go. T

  

the girl asks if auntie Toma will ever be free. And she says she doesn’t know, and leaves.

  

After going outside, she’s intercepted by the pursuers, and the bulky white haired woman. 

  

Toma takes out her axe, but the woman manages to disarm her. Her axe flies away, and she swears. 

  

She tries taking out her knife, and the woman takes out a shield with runes on it that light up. 

  

The shield attracts all the knives from Toma, and attaches to the surface.

  

“A magnetism rune”, Toma muttered. “Very well,” and flexed her muscles. She managed to take down the other assailants, and the woman stood there waiting

  

. She then laughed, as Toma tried to punch her armor. A rune lit up on the side of the chestplate, under the arm. “What? You think i'd skimp on basic precautions?”, she said, 

  

and kicked Toma down to the ground. “I’m taking you back to your cozy cell, Toma. Wouldn’t you like that?”

  

Hopper shows up, holding the axe. Their tiny little arms somehow are able to hold the entire thing. 

  

Both women are kind of stunned to see the little teal figure standing there, with a sprout on their head. 

  

They hand the axe to Toma, who uses it to shove away the woman. She yells after them “Is that a fucking fairy?!”. Toma says they gotta get away and grabs Hopper’s arm and drags them away.

  

The white haired woman takes out her sword, and it has some sparks from its runes. What? An electricity rune

  

Toma and Hopper goes down into the sewers, and through there, the “catacombs”.

  

 The white haired woman decides not to pursue, because the catacombs aren’t mapped out and it’s easy to get lost. While walking there,

  

 Toma tries to ask Hopper who they are. They don’t respond, they just look at Toma with big eyes, and then the axe. 

  

They start repeating words that Toma says, like Amethyst in the movie. Or Chobits.

Hopper wants to look at the axe, and Toma shows it off. She says there’s no way that the pursuers will go after them there anyway, so she can have them look at the runes.

  

 She says what runes are on the axe, and then they continue.

  

 Hopper shakes their head while walking, as if their head is buzzing. Then all of a sudden they can speak fluently (although childishly).

  

Toma and Hopper climb up into an inn full of dissidents, where she talks to the [[Innkeeper]]. 

  

Hopper sits on a chair next to her. 

  

Why would the innkeeper explain this info, what would she explain? what wouldn't she? Don't do “as you know dialogue”.

  

She asks for something to drink, and he asks why she’s coming through the secret pathways. And she explains her day, that she went to see the girl, and that she was almost caught by (Insert womans name here) again. The innkeeper asks her if she even knows what she’s doing. Just this week she had assaulted three military caravans, all by herself. Then she intercepted the poor sod who was carrying messages from neighboring Dta’Kotet and Radtek. “Those messages could have been clues to what the hell the military are importing so much Paritean steel for.”

“The simplest explanations are often the best, Toma. They’re preparing for war. So they need more armor and weapons. Besides, their steel is superior to ours and our mine's resources are dwindling.”

“It’s superior, because it’s easier to put runes on. I’m telling you, they’ve got to be building something terrifying in there. If they’re making new weapons, they’re not using them. They still use regular old burniron. And if they’re storing them somewhere, where? I infiltrated the barracks-”

“You mean you basically walked straight through the walls, using a hammer, and knocked everyone out? And inspected their arsenal?”

“I also lit the place on fire.”

“Yes. Very subtle. Nothing bad came of it, huh”

“But I escaped!”

“And they also tightened security to make such attacks more difficult in the future. And there’s been an increase of checkpoints since your activities ramped up, as well as public executions to “set an example”. And what if those barracks had important ledgers and documents that are now lost?”

“I’m detecting a lot of negative energy.”

“Be serious, Toma. You don’t know what you’re doing. You may be powerful, and smart. Fuck, you’re a genius, Toma. But you can’t do this alone. You’re willingly overlooking strategy because you think you’re invincible. Your mother wouldn’t want-”

“You do not have to bring her up.”

“I’m just saying-”

“You were serving me a drink, is what you were doing.”

  

“Fine. And who is this? Another kid you picked up?”

Hopper looks at them like this

Hopper

“The seed grows”

  

Toma

“Seeds of cooperation grows”

## Chapter 2

The axe had gotten chipped at a rune, so they went to a smith(what's their name :3 ?) to get it fixed. We get a basic explanation of how the runes work here. When she pays, the snake spits out a coin. Snakes are expensive, so not everyone has got one. They split up after this, since Toma has no reason to stick around, and Hopper runs around looking at different objects with runes on them.

  

Smith mentions the institute.

  

Hopper runs into the little girl, and is like ive only met a few people, including Toma. And the girl tells them what they think about Toma.

  

Hopper bumps into Casimir here, who is very rude. Hopper accidentally infiltrates the research facility™, into the portal room, then somehow no-clips through the wall (glitching a bit). They are now also wanted, and come back to the inn. Hopper can only open a portal right where they’re standing. The more solid the surface is, the more stable the portal is. It’s also exhausting to keep it open. Especially if you move away from it, it’s more exhausting. Closing and opening it is also difficult.

## Chapter 3

Toma becomes very curious and accepting of Hopper’s existence, trying to figure out all the things about them.

  

We hear some propaganda about how the institute advances technology and investigates the runes and their mechanics. Toma says that she doesn’t trust them.

  

They infiltrate the institution.(how? What does it look like? Guards, architecture, scientists, supply lines, etc. What route do they take for continuity reasons.)

  

At some point Toma can read something she’s not supposed to, but Hopper makes her able. (what? Is there something in this world she couldn't read? From another country? From another world? Is it maybe the reason they are investigating? Some fragment from another world? Or maybe just a code/new runes that she isn't familiar with.)

  

When Toma looks at the portal, we get a much more detailed explanation of the runes. Perhaps she reads research notes or blueprints?)

  

They get arrested, and Toma is forced to be an executioner again. (do we show it? How far does it go? Maybe it's really close to an execution and dramatic.)

## Chapter 4

This is where we get Toma’s flashback.

(how far? We should at least show how she first got made an executioner and how it affected her. Something about her parents and how she lost them, nami style. What the relationship with the rival was like and how it started, and how Toma knows the girl, she killed her terrible dad right?.)

  

 The other dissidents break Toma out, and she’s like “ugh i don't need your help I didn't ask for this.”

## Chapter 5

She tries to walk away, but realises she can’t leave everything behind. She has to get Hopper out. Here she defeats the rival, by accepting help a little bit. Hopper maybe uses some environmental thing, a machine or something. (Flashback to making an infiltration plan). Maybe turning off the lights. Toma pulls out a light / fire sword, they get away, and end up in a dead end. Somehow Hopper realises how to world hop(we gotta foreshadow this, how they’re thinking about it and a hint to what they “realize”, maybe some resonance thing or snake rune). The rival says something like “this is an honorless way to win” and Toma says the battle is too important for honor.

Hopper might have interfaced with the portal, accidentally helping them.
