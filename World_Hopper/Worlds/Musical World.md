bollywood vibes. mountains and fields. sparse population. using their illusion magic to thwart the technocracy. They have a tendency to get caught up in their songs. 

a singer can count another singer by “derailing” the song, in a good way. outsiders only defense is ear and eye protection, the effectiveness is proportional to how much they block. this ofc impairs them, needing to fight blind and deaf. or at very long distances, this is party effective, but the singers are good at staying hidden, countering long range tactics to some extent.

  

This gives the conflict a dune vibe. the singers are very much fighting on their turf.

  

use lots of mystical references and inspiration.
