The power here copies any ability at a low setting. Tomte’s adapt to whatever their surroundings are, copying the spirits around them. For instance, mole spirits or worm spirits, or fish spirits etc. If they have no spirits around, they would copy whatever magic is around them (runny nose from slime people etc).

  

The tomte lives in a world where the technocracy one day came and took over the mines. Now the community is forced to work in the mines, and they will be reliant on it. First of all, they can’t fight the authority because they’re too powerful and second, they would lose their jobs. The tomte is the butt of the joke a lot, for being so small and silly looking. He might betray the group at one point, expecting them to also laugh at him eventually. The dwarf guy looks a bit molelike, with a mole nose.
