The power system in this world is based on runes, specifically the size and number of runes. These runes can only change the properties of the object, like durability, density, temperature, buoyancy, viscosity, conduction, magnetism, reflectiveness, emission, phosphorescence. Each rune has to be written by a separate person simultaneously.

  

Worldhopper is able to make everyone around speak the same language.

  

We need to establish HOW people are oppressed

  

Axe woman idolises her parents, who were revolutionaries, but they’re dead and she doesn’t know how it works. They could have said someone was a bad guy, so she killed them. She was then made an executioner. 

  

Someone needs to rely on her, or she needs to rely on someone. Someone she’s attempting revolution for, who doesn’t want the revolution, or a child (maybe child of person she killed, brother bear style, it would be funny if the child hated their parent and is actually ok with the murder)

  

There has to be a smith, some warrior character, someone that represents the government, and also some child

  

Face of the government could be a rich builder trying to make the portal. He could be called Casimir

  

The story begins in the world of the axe woman, who is locked in battle with another strong warrior with a glaive. Because this doesn’t do anything to make her neither repent nor redeem herself and only lead to further trauma, she protests, fighting her way up against the army of the kingdom now finding herself locked with the country’s most powerful warrior. Maybe the main character supports her and gives her the chance for redemption.

  

This world allows enchantment of weapons, which is how the axe woman has enhanced her axe. She knows many ways to survive and fight, and can easily improvise during battle in order to win. Whenever they reach a new world, she will start by investigating the power system of that world.

Something about the rune world makes hopper figure out what's missing with the portal, and uses it to make their own portal for them and axe lady. The thing axe lady has a misconception about is exactly how revolution works, she doesn’t realise that she needs community and allies or what grassroots are, just stabbing the guards. What revolution means.

  

There is a huge object where smiths are putting runes on it, and it’s some secret thing. They’re working on a portal. (Casimir effect?)
