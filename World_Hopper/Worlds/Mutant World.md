The main overarching antagonists are a technocracy that are taking over more and more worlds. They’re looking for the main character, the Worldhopper, for some reason.

  
  

Power idea for the technocracy's evil guy. 

He has the ability to shape shift, i.e. manipulate the biology of other people.

themes. He is a biological essentialist, but he believes himself pure and perfect, and he “earned” everything he got, though in reality he mostly inherited.

  

limitations to the ability.

1. mass is conserved
    
2. he cannot use it on himself
    
3. he cannot add or change an S-gene
    
4. his dna has to make physical contact with the target, e.g. his hand or hair or blood etc.
    
5. the transformation takes time based on how drastically different it is (vague/subjective to us writers)
    

  

Inspiration: X Men

Themes: Eugenics, worth based on genes

  

This is the core of the technocracy. The magical mutant powers that exist in this world, come from real physical genes that channel spiritual energy. This world has a magitech vibe / Arcane. The fact that this gene exists is a cosmic fluke, they haven’t fully figured out how it works yet.

  

The lawyerwoman lives alone and has no friends. She has no special skills except for her perfect eidetic memory with which she has memorized every single lawbook. She works for the technocracy, and is a beast in the courtroom. She has colleagues, but she keeps their relationships purely professional. She has no home, and is an orphan. She lives by moving from hotel to hotel with her little suitcase, not even really eating the local cuisine. She lives on fast food. She spends a lot of time watching the news in the dark and otherwise reading up on law. She will be introduced long before she joins, serving as an opposing force for a bit. She specializes in prisoners rights but still believes that criminals should be punished.

  

She refuses to let the axewoman try to fight her way to victory, instead opting to play the game of the enemy and beating them in it. She had her past erased by the flyguy in order to start a new life.
