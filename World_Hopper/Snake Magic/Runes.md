Runes is a topic under [[Runology]]
## Description
Strongly typed
Each rune consists of individual radicals that each have to be written by a separate carver. Only some parts of each radical is
### Mechanics
An object can hold multiple runes
Multiple runes makes up an enchantment. An enchantment is limited by order of operations. For example, durability has to be put last.
Making runes big amplifies effect, but smaller but more makes more complex.
There is a plus rune so that several runes can be combined as though it was one large rune.
You can't draw a rune over another rune, because it would break a line. A rune also can't encroach on the surface area of another rune.
## Runes
### List of Property Runes
* Malleability (Can you flatten it, and roll it)
* Elasticity - Ability to return to original shape, opposite to Plasticity
* Ductility (Can you stretch it into a wire)
* Stiffness - Resistance to deformation
* Hardness (Can you scratch it)
* Vibration - Ability to vibrate
* Magnetism
* Force - Ability to push more, using snake force
* Toughness - Resistance to fracturing
* Transparency

### List of Auxiliary Runes
* Transference (Move force in direction) (Combine with vibration to do shock absorption)
* Delay - Requires a time specification
* Plus - Combines multiple runes as though they were one big rune. The effect amplification depends on the total combined surface area

A combination of auxiliary runes, delay + contain to make echoes?

### Blacklist
* Sharpness (Runes can not modify geometry)
* Viscosity
* Porosity - Ability to pass through liquids

## Applications - [[Rune Objects]]

Bring up to Casey
Resonance  - Ability to sustain vibration
Damping - Suppression of vibration over time
Thermal Conductivity
Conductivity - Auxiliary rune used with "magnetism", "temperature", "electricity" etc
Permeability - Ability to maintain a magnetic field
Friction
Attunement - Ability to harmonise with snake magic
Repeat (for loop?)
Threshold (if statement)
Sync (if trigger one rune, trigger another rune in another place. The sync radical of other rune must be drawn as the rune that triggers it)
Polarity - May be needed for MRI
Frequency
Permittivity - Ability for magnetic field to be deformed
Detection - Auxiliary rune that detects what its radical says
Focus - Auxiliary rune that focuses effect in a volume
